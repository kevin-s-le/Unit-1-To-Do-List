# Unit-1-To-Do-List
Like the product catalog program, this code is used to create a to-do list. The to-do list uses css code to not just style the page, but also changes the color of the tasks on every odd task.

It also uses JavaScript to allow you to add a new task to the list with the input form, but you are also able to click a button to remove an item from the list.
